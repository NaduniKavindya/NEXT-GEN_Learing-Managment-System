#### Brief Description of Project - The institution that we used is NextGen Higher Educational Centre in Galewela with about 200 students enrolled and about 20 teachers teaching different subjects in secondary education (O/L, A/L).
The system that we will be designing is able to manage and handle all the work carried out at this educational institution. Main stake holders of this system are students, teachers, institution management staff. Through this system the students in any grade can register, login, attend their lessons according to timetable and make payments and can obtain their relevant lessons. Teachers can register login upload the lessons or conduct online lessons, upload additional reading materials. The managers of the system can update timetables, update classrooms, update notices, mark attendance of the students. A system which could perform these actions were in need because in situations where the country has travel restrictions, lockdowns or any other hindrances for the students and teachers to conduct their academic activities physically, this system would make their work more secure, unchallenging and more easy. This increase the monitoring, reporting and analyzing learning processes more effectively.
 
#### Technologies used - Java,HTML,CSS,Javascript

Note - The student's github account should be given in brackets e.g. (IT20212232), this ideally should be your student id
